Google I/O (short for **Input/Output**) is Google's flagship annual developer conference. Held each spring—traditionally at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, and streamed worldwide—it gathers developers, product leaders, and tech enthusiasts to explore Google’s latest innovations across **Android**, **Chrome**, **AI/ML**, **Cloud**, and more.

### What Happens at Google I/O?

* **Keynote Address:** A high-profile opening session where Google’s executives unveil major product updates, strategic roadmaps, and surprise announcements.
* **Technical Sessions & Workshops:** Deep-dive presentations and codelabs on new APIs, design best practices, and platform integrations.
* **Sandboxes & Demos:** Hands-on areas where attendees can test unreleased features, interact with Google engineers, and provide feedback.
* **Community & Networking:** Office hours, meetups, and after-hours events foster connections among developers worldwide.

### Signature Announcements

While each year brings its own headline moments, typical reveals include:
